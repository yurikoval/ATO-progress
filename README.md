# Ukraine Anti-Terrorist Operation Progress in GIF

Ukraine is under attack from Russia. Russia supplies weapons and soldiers to fight in Eastern Ukraine.

#### Background

After [illegally annexing Crimea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation), Russia begins invading Ukraine under disguise of '[civil unrest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_pro-Russian_unrest_in_Ukraine)'. Weapons were supplied from Russia to terrorists and Russian soldiers in the East (in which case resulted in downing of [Malaysian MH17 airplane](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/07/17/malaysian-airlines-crash-ukraine-russia/12779763/)), who continued to terrorize the local Ukrainian population. This forced Ukraine to begin the Anti-Terrorist Operation.
